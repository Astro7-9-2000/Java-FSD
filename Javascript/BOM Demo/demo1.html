<!-- The BOM in JavaScript stands for Browser Object Model.

It is a collection of objects provided by the web browser to allow JavaScript to interact with the browser environment itself, 
outside of the actual content of the web page (which is handled by the DOM). -->
<!-- The global object of the BOM is the window object. -->
